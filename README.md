# Rename Multi-File

A simple Python script to rename all files in a specified directory that contain a specific string. This script allows users to input the directory, the string to be replaced, and the new string. The script then renames all matching files accordingly.

## Features

- Rename all files containing a specific string in their filename.
- Easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) built with `tkinter`.
- Error handling and success messages to guide the user.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or later
- `tkinter` (usually included with Python)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LoneNerd/rename-multi-file.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd rename-multi-file
```

3. Install the required dependencies (if any):

## Usage

3. Click on the "Rename" button to rename the files.

## Building an Executable

pip install pyinstaller
```

2. Run the following command to create an executable:
